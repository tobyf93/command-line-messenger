- New users not being able to see thread
- incoming messages interfering with outgoing messages
- When a message is send on the client, output to message prompt is shown as well
as timestamped message from server.  Perhaps i could create my own output stream
that controls when text should be output.  Idea - if the output doesn't have a
newline character output it to stdout as user needs to see what they are typing.
When user inserts a newline it means message has been submitted and we don't show
output until we receive message back from server.
